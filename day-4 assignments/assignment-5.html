			<h1>MY FAVORITE MOMENT IN MY ENGINEERING</h1>
			<img src="milkshake.jpg"style="float:right" width="300" height="300"><p>My favorite moment in my engineering out of many would be my friends and i going to canteen to get milkshake. We never came back straight to the class, it was always the longest path back which covered the ground, the washroom, every random class, saying hi to almost everyone we know.Coming to the milkshake, i enjoyed every sip of it. The main part of all this is staying in the canteen for a while and talking to our canteen uncle, its the best part besides the milkshake. Since i always had company to go to canteen it was even fun on my way to canteen and back to class. So my favorite moment in my engineering are the canteen raids we did when we had nothing better to do. </p>
